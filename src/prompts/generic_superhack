This is a list of financial strategies, each with a unique ID and a brief description:

{{group_of_hacks}}

---------------------------------------

Your task is to evaluate the feasibility of their combination into a SuperHack. You must assess:

- Conflict Avoidance: Check if any proposed combination of these financial strategies leads to contradictory or counter-productive tactics. For example, one hack that encourages taking on certain types of debt might conflict with another that advocates rapid debt elimination. Any combined strategy should have compatible principles.

- Synergy Enhancement: Identify if there exist pairs or groups of these strategies whose combination results in greater-than-additive benefits. For example, a budgeting strategy that frees up cash flow may synergize with an investment strategy that puts this freed capital to work, thus creating multiplicative benefits.

Determine whether some or all of the given strategies can be combined to form a 'SuperHack' that is more valuable and effective than using them individually. If so, choose the subset that yields the greatest synergy and avoids conflicts.

You must output a single JSON object with the following fields:
{
    "analysis": A descriptive analysis (string) explaining whether a SuperHack is feasible, identifying points of conflict or synergy, and reasoning behind the chosen combination.
    "superhack_feasible": A boolean (true or false) indicating if a SuperHack can be formed.
    "combined_strategies": A list of the IDs of the strategies you recommend combining. If no combination is possible, return an empty list.
    "explanation": A step-by-step explanation (string) of how to integrate the selected strategies into a cohesive SuperHack, detailing the order of operations, how resources flow between steps, and what actions to take to achieve multiplicative benefits.
